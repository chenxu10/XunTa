Interally, we can better identify duplicates in our database. For example, the same product from difference manufactures might exist in two places. ",Wayfair,E-commerce,Recommendation,Guess
2,Vinny DeGenova,How to frame this problem into machine learning problem?,"(1) Reduce this problem into a binary classification problem.
(2) Reduce this problem into a recommendation problem based on their simiality score in an embedding space.
For this problem, I am going to choose the first route because the confidence interval for whether they're the same product are quite high.",Wayfair,E-commerce,Recommendation,Guess
3,Vinny DeGenova,How to define the metrics?,"Classification problem metrics
(1) Confusion matrix and F score for each category
(2) AUC score
(3) False positive-threshold",Wayfair,E-commerce,Recommendation,Guess
4,Vinny DeGenova,How to preprocess visual images?,"We can embeds images into a 256-dimensional latent space. 
For example we can use some pretrained models like image net.",Wayfair,E-commerce,Recommendation,Guess
5,Vinny DeGenova,What is collaborative filtering?,"Collaborative filtering is an extremely popular technique for recommender systems today.
It aims to predict what a particular shopper will like based on how similar customers have 
behaved on site.
It is done using a matrix factorization approach, where the matrix factors represent latent representations of customers and their affinity to particular products.",Wayfair,E-commerce,Recommendation,Guess
6,Vinny DeGenova,What are two drawbacks of collaborative filtering?,Unable to recommend products that have no customer interaction. This is also known as the cold-start problem. Have difficulity to recommend less popular products.,Wayfair,E-commerce,Recommendation,Guess
